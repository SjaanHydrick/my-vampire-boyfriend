                <div>
                    Evan is a full-stack developer. In his free time he enjoys staring into the void of 2020 where his hobbies and social life used to live. Sometimes the void stares back, so he writes stories about vampires.
                    Evan’s vampire boyfriend would be of the Castlevania variety.

                <div>
                    Paul is definitely not a vampire.  He wishes people would focus on the fact that he is a full-stack developer, not that he sleeps in a coffin.  Lots of people sleep in coffins. Shut up.
                    Paul’s vampire boyfriend would be Brad Pitt’s Louis.

                    Sjaan is a vampire-enthusiast who recently moved to Portland. She enjoys video games, vampire fiction, and spending time with her cat. She thought of this project because who doesn’t want a vampire boyfriend?
                    Sjaan’s vampire boyfriend would be Eric Northman.

                <div>
                    Sydney is a people person and movie buff who lives in Portland. In her spare time she’s an avid home cook, gardener, and relentless house DIY’er. She chose this project because, “who doesn’t love a frivolous vampire romance?”
                    Her vampire boyfriend would be the Salvatore brothers.
